                                                You should have a verse and chorus prepared, so please start off with your best. 
                                                Remember that you can choose any part of the song to perform, so pick the part that best shows off your vocals.
                                                Also have a cover song prepared as well if you choose to sing an original. Most singing auditions are acapella.
                                                Please make sure you make your performance the very best. We want you to stand out. Pick a  well-known song.  In live performances It is always a good idea to have more than one song prepared, especially a few different genres or styles. Each audition is 2mins online video submitting and   only 90 seconds for live performances, but have in mind during the live performances  the Producers can stop you at anytime.
                                                But if a Producer asks to hear another song, it is good to be prepared. Preparations is the key.

                                                Incorporating tricks and new, unique choreography is always a great way to stand out to the producers and judges. A good way to show your personality and unique style is through your wardrobe/costume. If you are a big group it's always a good idea to dress in your team uniform or another fun costume.

                                                Sometimes the Producers will ask you what you have in store for the future and it's better to be prepared.
